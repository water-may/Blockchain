# Blockchain Cryptography Implementations

This repository contains basic Python implementations of classical cryptographic techniques. These techniques include Caesar, Monoalphabetic, and Vigenère ciphers.

## Features
- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher that shifts characters by a set number.
- **Monoalphabetic Cipher**: Uses a random substitution for encryption.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Uses a keyword to vary Caesar shifts.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/water-may/Blockchain.git
    ```
2. Run the scripts in Python:
    ```bash
    python <cipher_name>.py
    ```
