# Blockchain Cryptography Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of basic cryptographic algorithms. The focus is on classical encryption techniques such as Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, and Vigenère Cipher.

## Contents

- **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions.
- **Monoalphabetic Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by another letter from a shuffled alphabet.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: A method of encrypting text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/water-may/Blockchain.git
```

### Running the Code

You can run the individual cryptographic scripts using Python. For example:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```
